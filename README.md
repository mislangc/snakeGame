# Overview

This is my first PyGame project that helped me learn about PyGame and it's basic core concepts. PyGame is not game engine. This project introduced me to game events, collisions, keyboard input, game screen, drawing rectangle, character movement, game update, using audios, using images, using labels and scaling images. This also increased my understanding on python classes and vector2.

Controls:

- WASD keys

Losing Conditions:

- hitting the snake body
- hitting the border
- BUG! pressing the WASD keys too fast when reversing direction

Others:

- At the start of the game, the snake won't move until a WASD key is pressed. Has a sound effect effect when the snake eats the fruit. Shows a score label on the bottom right of the screen.
