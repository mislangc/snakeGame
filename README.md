# Overview

This is my first PyGame project that helped me learn about PyGame and it's basic core concepts. PyGame is not game engine. This project introduced me to game events, collisions, keyboard input, game screen, drawing rectangle, character movement, game update, using audios, using images, using labels and scaling images. This also increased my understanding on python classes and vector2.
